# What am I even hacking?

If you want to be a hacker you have to have a goal of someting you want to hack.

I reccomend Bug Bounties or CTF Challenges for a start. You will learn how to identify flags and uncover secrets in web applications or even computer apps. 
After learning CTF's learn Bug Bounty. If you want to practice do CTF's if you want money and have confidence, try a bug bounty at [Hackerone.com](https://hackerone.com/directory/programs).
For CTF I reccomend:
[PortSwigger.net](https://portswigger.net/web-security)
or
[PICO CTF](https://picoctf.org/)
