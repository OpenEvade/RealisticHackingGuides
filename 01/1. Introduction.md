# What do I need?
1. A computer running a linux operating system, for the packages we are using we will be using a linux system.
   to do this download virtual box [here](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.30/VirtualBox-6.1.30-148432-Win.exe) in order to run a virtual Linux OS on top      of your current OS reguardless the one you own. These are called *Virtual Machines* and they are very useful for many reasons. I reccomend getting a Raspberry Pi
   if you are really interested. Its a computer already set up to run linux. And the computer itself is only like $30-$40 but you do need a lcd screen or a monitor over 
   HDMI. There are too many things you can do with it to be honest it can be a Tiny Server, VPN, Gaming Console & way more. Pretty much whatever a computer can do, it
   can on a tiny scale.
2. OS (KALI OR PARROT OR RASPBIAN OR UBUNTU OR DEBIAN FOR THIS GUIDE)
3. A calm learning enviornment.
