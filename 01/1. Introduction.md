# What am I a need for?

1. A computer with a linux operating system; we will be using a linux system for the packages we will be using.

   To achieve this, go [here](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.30/VirtualBox-6.1.30-148432-Win.exe) and download virtual box to run a virtual Linux OS on top of your existing OS, regardless of which one you own.
   *Virtual Machines* are what they're called, and they're really handy for a variety of reasons.
   If you're serious about learning, I recommend acquiring a Raspberry Pi.
   It's a PC that's already configured to run Linux.
   The computer itself is only $30-$40, but you will need an LCD screen or an HDMI monitor.
   To be honest, there are just too many things you can do with it. It can be used as a Tiny Server, VPN, Gaming Console, and much more.
   Almost anything a computer can accomplish, it can do on a microscale. 
2. OS (KALI OR PARROT OR RASPBIAN OR UBUNTU OR DEBIAN FOR THIS GUIDE)
3. A calm learning enviornment.
