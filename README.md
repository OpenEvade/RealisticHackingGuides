#Introduction


Hello, in this tutorial, I'll be sharing my learning experience throughout time.

This project will cover the fundamentals of Metasploit attacks, exploit development, and penetration testing.


#A little about myself:


MrTwsT from OpenEvade here.

Throughout this guide, I will be instructing you.

I have over three years of programming experience, and I'd like to go into ethical hacking. I figured I could share my knowledge here.

This will only cover what I have learnt, but I hope it will help others understand the learning process.
